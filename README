this library contains a relatively fast LR(1) parser that I wrote for a project
in one of CS masters classes. I use it quite a lot and I hope that those who
use it will find it relatively easy to use as well.

Use the Starlight library to interact with this library as there is only the
parser and few other items in here. 

I have some legacy items in here that are relics of my research efforts to make
this code far faster.
